# GitHub Release Plan - Structures & Quiver Packages

**Created**: 2025-01-17
**Status**: READY FOR EXECUTION (after book images are added)
**Author**: Wayne Bishop

---

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Quiver Package - Complete
- **Version**: v1.0.0 ✓
- **Repository**: `bishop-algorithms-quiver-package`
- **GitHub Release**: https://github.com/waynewbishop/bishop-algorithms-quiver-package/releases/tag/1.0.0
- **Status**: DONE - Formal release exists

### ⚠️ Structures Package - Needs Release
- **Current Version**: v0.5.2 (tagged, no release page)
- **Repository**: `bishop-algorithms-swift-package`
- **GitHub Tag**: https://github.com/waynewbishop/bishop-algorithms-swift-package/releases/tag/0.5.2
- **Status**: Tag exists, but NO formal GitHub Release created
- **Recommended Action**: Bump to v1.0.0 and create release

---

## 🎯 Recommendation: Go to v1.0.0

### Why Bump from 0.5.2 → 1.0.0?

**Rationale:**
1. **Book alignment**: Published book references both packages at production quality
2. **Consistency**: Quiver is already at 1.0.0, Structures should match
3. **Production-ready**: Code has been used in production for years
4. **API stability**: All book examples verified 100% aligned with package code
5. **Natural milestone**: Book publication is perfect time to declare 1.0
6. **User perception**: "0.5.2" suggests experimental, but code is battle-tested

**Version mismatch problem:**
- Quiver v1.0.0 says "production ready"
- Structures v0.5.2 says "pre-release, API may change"
- Book references both as stable → Mixed signals to users

**Release notes will explain:**
> "This package has been in production use for years. The 1.0.0 designation reflects API stability, comprehensive testing, and feature completeness as documented in the companion book."

---

## 📋 Complete Action Plan

### Step 1: Verify Current State (5 minutes)

Run these commands to check what's changed since v0.5.2:

```bash
# Navigate to Structures package
cd "/Users/waynebishop/Projects/bishop-algorithms-swift-package"

# Check current status
git status

# See what commit v0.5.2 points to
git show v0.5.2 --quiet

# See what's changed since v0.5.2
git log v0.5.2..HEAD --oneline

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Verify tests pass
swift test

# Verify clean build
swift build
```

**Decision point:**
- If `git log` shows no commits → HEAD is same as v0.5.2 → Use Step 2A
- If `git log` shows commits → HEAD is ahead → Use Step 2B

---

### Step 2A: If HEAD is Same as v0.5.2 (Retag Approach)

Use this if no changes have been made since v0.5.2 was tagged.

```bash
# Delete old local tag
git tag -d v0.5.2

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.5.2

# Create new v1.0.0 tag at same commit
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0

First stable release of Structures package.

This release marks production readiness and coincides with the publication
of 'Swift Algorithms & Data Structures' book. The code has been in production
use for years and demonstrates API stability.

Features:
- Core data structures: LinkedList, Stack, Queue, BST, Graph, Trie, Hash Tables, Heap
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Quicksort
- Search algorithms: Linear, Binary
- Graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra (array and heap variants)
- Complete test suite
- 100% alignment with book code examples

Version history: 0.5.2 → 1.0.0 (marking production stability)

This release corresponds to the code examples in 'Swift Algorithms & Data
Structures' book by Wayne Bishop."

# Push new tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0.0

# Verify tag exists
git tag -l "v1.0.0"
```

---

### Step 2B: If HEAD is Ahead of v0.5.2 (Tag Current HEAD)

Use this if changes have been committed since v0.5.2.

```bash
# Tag current HEAD as v1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0

First stable release of Structures package.

This release marks production readiness and coincides with the publication
of 'Swift Algorithms & Data Structures' book. The code has been in production
use for years and demonstrates API stability.

# Push tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0.0

# Verify tag exists
git tag -l "v1.0.0"
```

1. Click "Releases" in right sidebar
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Choose tag: `v1.0.0` (from dropdown)
4. Release title: `Structures v1.0.0 - Production Ready`
5. Copy description from template below
6. Check "Set as the latest release"
7. Click "Publish release"
