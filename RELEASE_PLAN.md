git push
```

---

### Step 1.2: Verify Structures Package (5 minutes)

**Check what's changed since v0.5.2:**

```bash
cd /Users/waynebishop/Projects/bishop-algorithms-swift-package

# See commits since v0.5.2
git log v0.5.2..HEAD --oneline

# Verify tests pass
swift test

# Verify clean build
swift build

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current  # Should be 'main' or 'master'
```

**Decision point:**
- **If `git log` shows 0 commits** (README commit is the only change): Use Step 1.3A (retag)
- **If `git log` shows commits**: Use Step 1.3B (tag current HEAD)

---

### Step 1.3A: Tag v1.0.0 (Retag Approach) (5 minutes)

**Use this if:** HEAD is same as v0.5.2 (only README was updated)

```bash
cd /Users/waynebishop/Projects/bishop-algorithms-swift-package

# Delete old local tag
git tag -d v0.5.2

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.5.2

# Create v1.0.0 tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0 - Production Ready

# Push tag
git push origin v1.0.0

# Verify
git tag -l "v1.0.0"
```

---

### Step 1.3B: Tag v1.0.0 (Current HEAD Approach) (5 minutes)

**Use this if:** HEAD is ahead of v0.5.2 (changes have been committed)

```bash
cd /Users/waynebishop/Projects/bishop-algorithms-swift-package

# Tag current HEAD
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0 - Production Ready

First stable release of Structures package.

This release marks production readiness and coincides with the publication

**File**: `/Users/waynebishop/Projects/swift-algorithms/_config.yml`

Add after the `author` line:

```yaml
author: Wayne Bishop
google_analytics: G-XXXXXXXXXX  # Replace with your actual ID
```

#### Update head.html

**File**: `/Users/waynebishop/Projects/swift-algorithms/_includes/head.html`

Add before closing `</head>` tag:

```html
  <!-- Google Analytics -->
  {% if site.google_analytics %}
  <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id={{ site.google_analytics }}"></script>
  <script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', '{{ site.google_analytics }}');
  </script>
  {% endif %}
</head>
```

#### Commit and Deploy

```bash
cd /Users/waynebishop/Projects/swift-algorithms

git add _config.yml _includes/head.html
git commit -m "Add Google Analytics tracking

Added GA4 tracking to monitor book readership:
- Added google_analytics property to _config.yml
- Integrated GA tracking script in head.html
- Conditional loading (only when google_analytics is set)

Measurement ID: G-XXXXXXXXXX"
git push
```

#### Verify Installation (after GitHub Pages rebuilds)

1. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages rebuild
2. Visit your book site
3. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí **Network** tab
4. Reload page ‚Üí Look for `googletagmanager.com` requests
5. Go to Google Analytics ‚Üí **Reports** ‚Üí **Realtime**
6. Your visit should appear within 30 seconds

**Benefits:**

**Execution Tips:**

1. **Work sequentially**: Complete Phase 1 before Phase 2, Phase 2 before Phase 3
2. **Test as you go**: Verify each step before moving to next
3. **Save your book URL**: You'll need it multiple times across phases
4. **Take breaks**: 90 minutes is long - pause between phases if needed
5. **Keep terminal open**: You'll switch between repos frequently
6. **Proofread release notes**: Check for typos and correct URLs before publishing

**Good luck with your release! üöÄ**
