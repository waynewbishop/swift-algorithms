# Introduction

If we're learning Swift development, we may be asking: do I need to know AI and machine learning to be relevant, why learn algorithms when AI can generate code for me, or how do recommendation systems work—the ones that power Netflix and Spotify? These are the right questions. The surprising answer is they all lead back to the same place—fundamental [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that have existed for decades.

These days technology is amazing. Generative AI understands your questions. Instagram knows what you'll like next. Google autocomplete predicts what we're typing after just three letters. Your iPhone unlocks instantly with Face ID. But here's the secret: it's not magic. It's mathematics—specifically, algorithms that computer scientists developed between 1946 and the early 2000s, now applied in ways their creators never imagined.

## The platform

When Swift debuted in 2014, it was Apple's answer to modern iOS development. Ten years later, Swift has evolved into something far more powerful—a full-stack language that spans far beyond the iPhone. Today's Swift gives you SwiftUI for declarative, reactive interfaces across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS. Swift Concurrency with a`sync/await` makes asynchronous code as readable as synchronous code—crucial for network requests, database operations, and AI model inference. Swift Package Manager lets you share your algorithm implementations as reusable libraries. Swift Testing provides modern, expressive test suites that verify your algorithms work correctly at scale. And solutions like Vapor take Swift to the server, allowing you to create backend APIs that power websites, online services, and cloud-based applications. You can build your iOS app and its backend API in the same language, sharing the same algorithm implementations.

This versatility matters because the semantic search system we'll build in Chapter 19 can power an iOS app's local search, a server API's document retrieval, or Vision Pro's spatial content discovery—using identical Swift code. The same [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) algorithms from Chapter 11 that optimize navigation in your iOS app can route requests in your server backend. One language, one codebase, infinite possibilities.

Modern AI systems run on vector mathematics. Every recommendation engine, semantic search system, and machine learning model converts data into [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector) and performs mathematical operations on them. That's where the Quiver framework comes in. Built specifically for Swift developers, Quiver provides production-ready vector operations with a clean, intuitive API. This isn't just academic math—it's how Netflix picks your next show, how Spotify builds playlists, how e-commerce sites recommend products. And with Quiver, it's pure Swift with type safety, performance, and zero dependencies. You'll use Quiver throughout Chapters 18 through 19 to build AI systems: semantic search engines, recommendation algorithms, and document similarity systems. It's the bridge between classical computer science and modern AI development.

## The algorithm lineage

Understanding modern technology means understanding the classical algorithms that power it. Binary search, invented in 1946 for dictionary lookups, now powers vector database indexes in modern AI search systems. Tries, developed in 1968 for efficient string storage, became the foundation for Google's autocomplete in 2004 and every modern suggestion system. PageRank, Larry Page's 1998 breakthrough for ranking web pages, evolved into the attention mechanisms that power today's transformer-based AI models. Hash tables from the 1960s, originally used for compiler symbol tables, now enable real-time session management in web applications and locality-sensitive hashing for vector search.

These algorithms didn't just inspire modern systems—they are the building blocks. When we use semantic search in Chapter 20, we're combining vector embeddings with k-nearest neighbors search, a technique from the 1960s. When we implement PageRank in Chapter 18, we're learning the same iterative algorithm that influenced how neural networks process attention. When we build tries in Chapter 13, we're using the exact data structure that made Google Suggest possible.

## What we'll learn

This book teaches fundamental algorithms and data structures through production Swift code. We'll understand not just how algorithms work, but why they matter and where they're used in modern development.

We'll start with searching and sorting algorithms in Chapters 3-5, building intuition for algorithm design and performance analysis. Chapter 7 introduces Swift generics, showing how one algorithm can work with any data type—the foundation for every data structure in this book. Chapters 8-15 cover essential data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, graphs, tries, hash tables, and heaps. Each chapter shows both the theory and the production implementation.

The advanced chapters demonstrate how these fundamentals power modern systems. Chapter 16 teaches dynamic programming, the optimization technique behind route planning and recommendation systems. Chapter 18 covers PageRank, Google's original algorithm that revolutionized web search and influenced modern AI architectures. Chapter 19 introduces the Quiver framework for vector mathematics, and Chapter 20 shows how to build semantic search systems using word embeddings and cosine similarity—the same techniques that power AI-driven search and recommendations.

By the end, we'll understand how classical computer science enables modern AI, and we'll have production-ready Swift implementations we can use in your own projects.

## How this book is organized

The book progresses from fundamental concepts to advanced applications:

**Part 1: Fundamentals (Chapters 1-2)** establishes why algorithms matter and introduces performance analysis. We'll learn to think about efficiency and understand Big O notation, the common language developers use to discuss algorithm performance.

**Part 2: Core Algorithms (Chapters 3-6)** teaches searching, sorting, and recursion. These chapters build algorithmic intuition through hands-on implementations of linear search, binary search, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.

**Part 3: Swift Concepts (Chapter 7-8)** covers generics and performance analysis in depth. We'll learn how to write reusable algorithm implementations that work with any data type while understanding the performance implications of your design choices.

**Part 4: Data Structures (Chapters 9-15)** presents the essential data structures every developer should know: linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, graphs, tries, hash tables, and heaps. Each chapter includes complete Swift implementations with real-world applications.

**Part 5: Advanced Topics (Chapters 16-20)** demonstrates how fundamentals enable advanced systems. We'll implement dynamic programming optimizations, understand PageRank's influence on modern AI, work with the Quiver framework for vector mathematics, and build semantic search systems using word embeddings.

## Prerequisites

This book assumes we're comfortable with Swift basics: variables, functions, classes, structs, optionals, and common design patterns like protocols and delegation. We should be able to read and write Swift code confidently, understand basic control flow, and be familiar with Swift collections like arrays and dictionaries.

We don't need advanced computer science knowledge. Mathematical concepts like logarithms and vector operations are explained from first principles when needed. Prior experience with algorithms is helpful but not required—we build from fundamentals.

The book includes production code from the Swift Structures package, available at the author's GitHub repository. While we can read the book without running code, we'll learn more by experimenting with the implementations and running the test suites.

## Your path forward

Master the fundamentals, and we'll understand everything built on top. This book teaches those fundamentals in production Swift code. We'll build working implementations using modern Swift features—generics, protocols, async/await, and the Quiver framework for vector operations. Every chapter connects classical algorithms to their modern applications, showing us not just how they work, but why they matter and where we'll use them.

The algorithms we'll learn aren't just academic exercises—they're the foundation of every technology we use daily. Understanding them means understanding how modern systems really work, from AI search engines to recommendation systems to graph-based social networks. More importantly, it means we'll know which algorithm to choose when solving our own problems, and we'll understand the performance implications of our decisions.
