# Introduction

If you're learning Swift development you may be asking, "do I need to know AI and machine learning to be relevant", "why learn algorithms when AI can generate code for me" or "how do recommendation systems work—the ones that power Netflix and Spotify"? These are the right questions. The surprising answer is they all lead back to the same place—fundamental algorithms that have existed for decades.

These days technology is amazing. Generative AI understands your questions. Instagram knows what you'll like next. Google autocomplete predicts what you're typing after just three letters. Your iPhone unlocks instantly with Face ID. But here's the secret: it's not magic. It's mathematics—specifically, algorithms that computer scientists developed between 1946 and the early 2000s, now applied in ways their creators never imagined.

## Swift as the platform

When Swift debuted in 2014, it was Apple's answer to modern iOS development. Ten years later, Swift has evolved into something far more powerful—a full-stack language that spans far beyond the iPhone. Today's Swift gives you SwiftUI for declarative, reactive interfaces across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS. Swift Concurrency with a`sync/await` makes asynchronous code as readable as synchronous code—crucial for network requests, database operations, and AI model inference. Swift Package Manager lets you share your algorithm implementations as reusable libraries. Swift Testing provides modern, expressive test suites that verify your algorithms work correctly at scale. And solutions like Vapor take Swift to the server, allowing you to create backend APIs that power websites, online services, and cloud-based applications. You can build your iOS app and its backend API in the same language, sharing the same algorithm implementations.

This versatility matters because the semantic search system you'll build in Chapter 19 can power an iOS app's local search, a server API's document retrieval, or Vision Pro's spatial content discovery—using identical Swift code. The same graph algorithms from Chapter 11 that optimize navigation in your iOS app can route requests in your server backend. One language, one codebase, infinite possibilities.

Modern AI systems run on vector mathematics. Every recommendation engine, semantic search system, and machine learning model converts data into vectors and performs mathematical operations on them. That's where the Quiver framework comes in. Built specifically for Swift developers, Quiver provides production-ready vector operations with a clean, intuitive API. This isn't just academic math—it's how Netflix picks your next show, how Spotify builds playlists, how e-commerce sites recommend products. And with Quiver, it's pure Swift with type safety, performance, and zero dependencies. You'll use Quiver throughout Chapters 18 through 19 to build AI systems: semantic search engines, recommendation algorithms, and document similarity systems. It's the bridge between classical computer science and modern AI development.

## Your path forward

Master the fundamentals, and you'll understand everything built on top. This book teaches those fundamentals in production Swift code. You'll build working implementations using modern Swift features—generics, protocols, async/await, and the Quiver framework for vector operations. Every chapter connects classical algorithms to their modern applications, showing you not just how they work, but why they matter and where you'll use them.
