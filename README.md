# Swift Algorithms & Data Structures - 5th Edition

iOS and macOS developers work with data constantly—user metrics, sensor readings, analytics, and performance measurements. [This book](index.md) teaches you how to aggregate, analyze, and present that data efficiently using algorithms, data structures, and statistical operations built specifically for Swift.

Going beyond pseudocode and theory, every concept is implemented in production-ready Swift code. From fundamental algorithms to advanced mathematical operations, you'll learn the computational thinking that powers modern iOS development.

## What you'll learn

**Core Algorithms & Data Structures**
- Master Big O notation and algorithmic efficiency—understand why some operations feel instant while others lag
- Compare search strategies (linear vs binary) and sorting algorithms (insertion, bubble, quicksort, merge sort)
- Build linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables from scratch using Swift's type system

**Advanced Topics**
- Work with vectors and matrices for numerical computing and data science workflows
- Apply transformations using linear algebra fundamentals
- Build semantic search using vector mathematics and similarity operations
- Explore graph algorithms including shortest paths and PageRank
- Master dynamic programming and tries for optimization problems

**Swift-Specific Patterns**
- Write generic, type-safe algorithms that work with any data type
- Build reusable components following Swift's API design guidelines

## Who this book is for

**This book is for:**
- iOS and macOS developers who want to work confidently with data
- Swift developers preparing for technical interviews
- Experienced developers from other languages learning Swift's approach to algorithms
- Anyone building data-driven features (analytics, recommendations, search, visualizations)
- Educators teaching computer science or data analysis with Swift

**You should have:**
- Basic Swift proficiency (variables, functions, loops, optionals)
- Some familiarity with Xcode or Swift Playgrounds
- No prior algorithms or mathematics background required

## Companion Package: Quiver

[Quiver](https://github.com/waynewbishop/bishop-algorithms-quiver-package) extends Swift's standard `Array` type with mathematical and statistical functions:
- Calculate statistical measures (mean, median, variance, standard deviation)
- Detect outliers and validate data quality
- Aggregate time-series data and compute growth rates
- Normalize and scale data for visualization
- Perform vector operations for similarity and distance calculations

See the [full documentation](https://github.com/waynewbishop/bishop-algorithms-quiver-package) for code examples and API reference.
