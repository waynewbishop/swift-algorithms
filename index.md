# Swift Algorithms & Data Structures

A comprehensive guide to algorithms and data structures in Swift, designed for iOS developers who want to master computer science fundamentals while building practical, type-safe implementations.

## Overview

Swift, first introduced by Apple in 2014, has become the cornerstone of development across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. This book provides complete implementations of essential algorithms and data structures in modern Swift, going beyond pseudocode to show you how these concepts work in production code.

Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, building performance-critical applications, or simply want to deepen your understanding of computer science, this book offers clear explanations, practical examples, and real-world Swift implementations.

## What You'll Learn

- Understand why algorithms matter in development
- Apply Big O notation to analyze efficiency
- Implement linear and binary search algorithms
- Create bubble, insertion, and selection sorts
- Analyze merge sort and quicksort performance
- Apply recursion to solve complex problems
- Build type-safe code with Swift generics
- Create singly and doubly linked lists
- Implement stacks and queues from scratch
- Build binary search trees with traversal
- Model relationships using graph data structures
- Create tries for efficient string operations
- Design hash tables with collision handling
- Implement heaps for priority queue operations
- Apply dynamic programming with memoization techniques
- Evaluate real-world algorithm performance tradeoffs
- Calculate vector operations for spatial data
- Analyze PageRank algorithm for ranking systems

## Example: Generic Binary Search

Here's a taste of what you'll build—a generic binary search that works with any comparable type:

```swift
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    func binarySearch(for target: Element) -> Int? {
        var left = 0
        var right = count - 1

        while left <= right {
            let mid = (left + right) / 2
            let midValue = self[mid]

            if midValue == target {
                return mid
            } else if midValue < target {
                left = mid + 1
            } else {
                right = mid - 1
            }
        }

        return nil
    }
}

// Works with any comparable type
let numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
numbers.binarySearch(for: 7)  // Returns 3

let words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
words.binarySearch(for: "cherry")  // Returns 2
```

This binary search runs in O(log n) time—finding an element in a million-item array takes only about 20 comparisons!
