# Swift Algorithms & Data Structures - 5th Edition

The Swift language has become the cornerstone of Apple development, powering solutions for iPhone, WatchOS, VisionOS, server-based solutions and beyond. This online book provides complete implementations of essential algorithms, data structures and mathematics in modern Swift, going beyond pseudocode to show you how these concepts work in production code.

## What you'll learn

- Master Big O notation and learn to evaluate algorithmic efficiency
- Comparing linear and binary search, understand constant time operations and sorting algorithms
- Build type-safe, reusable code using Swift's generic system
- Create linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables from scratch
- Explore tries, heaps, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms like PageRank
- Learn linear algebra fundamentals for data science, including working with vectors and matrices
- Apply vector mathematics to create customized semantic search models

## Audience

This book is designed for:

- Swift developers looking to strengthen their computer science fundamentals
- Experienced developers in other languages interested in learning Swift
- Interview candidates preparing for technical coding interviews
- Developers interested in data science
- Educators looking for teaching materials related to computer science or mathematics
