# "You" to "We" Conversion Report
## Swift Algorithms Book - Collaborative Voice Analysis

This report identifies instances where "you/your/you'll/you're" should be changed to "we/our/we'll/we're" to create a collaborative journey with the reader rather than a directive tone.

## Summary Statistics

### By Category:
1. **Cross-Chapter References:** ~35 instances
   - Pattern: "In Chapter X, you'll see/learn/build..."
   - Recommendation: Change all to "we'll see/learn/build..."

   - Pattern: "You'll understand/learn/build..."
   - Recommendation: Change to "We'll understand/learn/build..."

3. **Instructional Language:** ~40 instances

## Recommended Approach

**Global Search & Replace Patterns:**
The following patterns can be safely replaced globally:

1. `"In Chapter \d+, you'll"` → `"In Chapter \d+, we'll"`
2. `"you'll learn"` → `"we'll learn"`
3. `"you'll see"` → `"we'll see"`
4. `"you'll understand"` → `"we'll understand"`
5. `"you'll build"` → `"we'll build"`
6. `"you can use"` → `"we can use"`
7. `"you can maintain"` → `"we can maintain"`
8. `"you need to"` → `"we need to"`
9. `"you might"` → `"we might"`
10. `"when you"` → `"when we"`

**Context-Sensitive Cases:**
Some instances should remain as "you" because they describe external systems or rhetorical questions:
- "Instagram knows what you'll like next" (describes Instagram, not instruction)
- "If you're learning Swift" (opening rhetorical hook - could go either way)
- Examples and analogies: "Imagine you're looking for..." (could change to "Imagine we're looking for...")

**Sections Needing Manual Review:**
- Prerequisites sections (Chapter 1, line 57): "This book assumes you're comfortable..."
  - Could remain as "you" since it's qualification criteria
  - OR change to "we're" for consistency

## Next Steps

1. **Review this report** and approve the conversion strategy
2. **Decide on prerequisites sections** - keep "you" or change to "we"?
3. **Execute global replacements** for the safe patterns listed above
4. **Manual review** of context-sensitive cases
5. **Final pass** to ensure natural flow with "we" voice

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for complete conversion across all 20 chapters
