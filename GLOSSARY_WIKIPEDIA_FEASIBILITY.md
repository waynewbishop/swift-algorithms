- **Technical Terms:** 30 terms (Node, Edge, Vertex, Pivot, etc.)

---

## 2. Technical Approach

### Method 1: Automated Search with Manual Review (RECOMMENDED)

**Process:**
1. Extract all 90 glossary terms into a list
2. For each term, use `grep` to find first occurrence in chapter order
3. Manually verify the context is appropriate for linking
4. Add Wikipedia link using markdown format: `[term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term)`
5. Document all changes for future reference

**Advantages:**
- Systematic and thorough
- Can verify context before linking
- Generates audit trail

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-intensive (4-6 hours)
- Requires manual judgment for each term

### Method 2: Fully Automated (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Process:**
1. Write script to extract terms and automatically insert links
2. Run script across all chapters
3. Review output

**Advantages:**
- Faster initial implementation (1-2 hours)

**Disadvantages:**
- High risk of false positives (see challenges below)
- May link inappropriate contexts
- Difficult to verify correctness
- Could break existing formatting

---

## 3. Challenges Identified

### Challenge 1: Ambiguous Terms

**Problem:** Some terms have different meanings in different contexts.

**Examples:**
- **"Set"**: Data structure vs. verb ("set the value")
- **"Stack"**: Data structure vs. "stack overflow" or "call stack"
- **"Tree"**: Data structure vs. phrase tree or decision tree
- **"Path"**: Graph concept vs. file path
- **"Weight"**: Graph edge weight vs. font weight
- **"Height"**: Tree height vs. screen height

**Impact:** Requires manual verification to avoid linking wrong contexts

**Example False Positive:**
```markdown
# Wrong context - should NOT be linked:
"You can set the value..." → linking "set" to Set data structure

# Correct context - SHOULD be linked:
"A Set provides O(1) membership testing..." → link to Set
```

### Challenge 2: Plural and Variant Forms

**Problem:** Terms appear in multiple grammatical forms.

**Examples:**
- "array" vs "arrays"
- "node" vs "nodes"
- "algorithm" vs "algorithms"
- "sort" vs "sorting" vs "sorted"
- "hash function" vs "hashing"

**Impact:** Simple word matching will miss variants; need pattern matching

### Challenge 3: Case Sensitivity

**Problem:** Terms appear in different cases (title case, lowercase, code).

**Examples:**
- "Binary Search" (title) vs "binary search" (prose) vs `binarySearch()` (code)
- "Big O Notation" vs "big O notation"
- "Swift" (language) vs "swift" (adjective)

**Impact:** Must handle case-insensitive matching while preserving original formatting

### Challenge 4: Terms in Code Blocks

**Problem:** Terms appear in code examples where they shouldn't be linked.

**Example:**
```swift
// Should NOT link "Array", "Node", "Iterator" here:
struct Node<T> {
    var value: T
    var next: Node<T>?
}

let items: [Int] = Array(1...10)
```

**Impact:** Must exclude code blocks from search/replace

### Challenge 5: Wikipedia URL Mapping

**Problem:** Not all glossary terms map directly to Wikipedia URLs.

**Examples:**
- Glossary: "Constant Time - O(1)" → Wikipedia: "Time_complexity"
- Glossary: "k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)" → Wikipedia: "K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm"
- Glossary: "FIFO (First-In-First-Out)" → Wikipedia: "FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)"
- Glossary: "Binary Search Tree (BST)" → Wikipedia: "Binary_search_tree"

**Impact:** Requires manual Wikipedia URL lookup for each term

### Challenge 6: Already-Linked Terms

**Problem:** Some terms may already have links (internal chapter references, production code).

**Example:**
```markdown
See [Chapter 13](13-graphs.md) for more on graph algorithms.
# Should NOT add Wikipedia link to "graph" here
```

**Impact:** Must check if term is already part of a markdown link

### Challenge 7: Compound Terms

**Problem:** Some glossary entries are multi-word phrases.

**Examples:**
- "Binary Search Tree"
- "Depth-First Search"
- "Dynamic Programming"
- "Hash Table"

**Impact:** Must match entire phrase, not individual words

---

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation (30 minutes)

1. **Extract Terms:**
   - Parse glossary.md to extract all 90 terms
   - Create terms list with variants (singular/plural, case variations)

2. **Map Wikipedia URLs:**
   - Manually verify Wikipedia article exists for each term
   - Create mapping: glossary term → Wikipedia URL
   - Handle special cases (redirects, disambiguation pages)

3. **Define Exclusion Patterns:**
   - Code blocks (between triple backticks)
   - Inline code (between single backticks)
   - Existing markdown links
   - Diagram placeholders

### Phase 2: Search for First Occurrences (2-3 hours)

**For each term:**
1. Search chapters 01-20 in sequence for first occurrence
2. Verify context is appropriate (not in code, correct meaning)
3. Check if already linked
4. Note line number and file

**Create Change Log:**
```markdown
- Chapter 3, Line 24: "binary search" → [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)
- Chapter 9, Line 45: "linked list" → [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)
```

### Phase 3: Apply Changes (1-2 hours)

1. For each verified occurrence, add Wikipedia link
2. Use Edit tool to make precise replacements
3. Preserve existing formatting (backticks, emphasis, etc.)

### Phase 4: Verification (30 minutes)

1. Build site locally to verify links work
2. Check for broken Wikipedia links
3. Verify no formatting issues introduced
4. Scan for any accidental double-linking

---

## 5. Example Changes

### Example 1: Simple Term

**File:** `03-basic-searching.md`
**Line:** 24

**Before:**
```markdown
Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that repeatedly divides a sorted
collection in half.
```

**After:**
```markdown
[Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) is a
divide-and-conquer algorithm that repeatedly divides a sorted collection in half.
```

---

### Example 2: Compound Term

**File:** `09-linked-lists.md`
**Line:** 15

**Before:**
```markdown
A linked list is a data structure where elements are stored in nodes containing
both data and references to the next node.
```

**After:**
```markdown
A [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a data structure
where elements are stored in nodes containing both data and references to the next node.
```

---

### Example 3: Term with Context Check

**File:** `08-performance-analysis.md`
**Line:** 120

**Before:**
```markdown
We can analyze the complexity of this function by counting operations.
```

**After:**
```markdown
We can analyze the [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity)
of this function by counting operations.
```

**Note:** First occurrence of "complexity" as a noun (appropriate context)

---

### Example 4: Skip Code Context

**File:** `10-stacks-and-queues.md`
**Line:** 85

**Should NOT link:**
```swift
class Stack<T> {  // ← "Stack" in code block, don't link
    private var items: [T] = []
}
```

**Link this instead (Line 30):**
```markdown
A [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) is a
Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
```

---

## 6. Effort Estimate

| Phase | Task | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| 1 | Term extraction & Wikipedia URL mapping | 30 min |
| 2 | Search for first occurrences (90 terms × 2 min avg) | 3 hours |
| 3 | Apply changes with Edit tool | 1.5 hours |
| 4 | Verification & testing | 30 min |
| **Total** | | **5.5 hours** |

**Breakdown by complexity:**
- **Simple terms** (50 terms): 1 min each = 50 min
- **Compound terms** (30 terms): 2 min each = 60 min
- **Ambiguous terms** (10 terms): 5 min each = 50 min
- **Wikipedia URL mapping:** 30 min
- **Changes application:** 90 min
- **Verification:** 30 min

## 8. Alternative Approaches

### Alternative 1: Link Glossary to Wikipedia (Lighter Touch)

**Approach:** Instead of linking first occurrences in chapters, add Wikipedia links to glossary entries.

**Changes:**
```markdown
## G

**Graph** - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type))
A data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges.
```

**Advantages:**
- Much faster (1 hour vs 5.5 hours)
- Centralized - all links in one place
- Doesn't disrupt chapter reading flow
- Easy to maintain

**Disadvantages:**
- Less convenient for readers (must go to glossary first)
- Doesn't enhance chapter credibility directly

**Effort:** 1 hour

---

### Alternative 2: Curated Linking (Strategic Terms Only)

**Approach:** Link only 15-20 most important terms where first occurrence is pedagogically appropriate.

**Strategic Terms:**
1. Algorithm
2. Big O Notation
3. Binary Search
4. Hash Table
5. Linked List
6. Stack
7. Queue
8. Tree
9. Graph
10. Dynamic Programming
11. Recursion
12. Time Complexity
13. Space Complexity
14. Heap
15. Trie

**Advantages:**
- Focuses on foundational concepts
- Less cluttered appearance
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Can choose optimal linking moments

**Disadvantages:**
- Arbitrary cutoff (why 15 vs 30?)
- Inconsistent treatment of terms

**Effort:** 1.5 hours

---

### Alternative 3: Footnotes/Endnotes

**Approach:** Use footnote-style references to Wikipedia.

**Example:**
```markdown
Binary search[^1] is a divide-and-conquer algorithm...

[^1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm
```

**Advantages:**
- Doesn't disrupt inline reading
- Clear that it's a reference, not navigation
- Easy to add/remove

**Disadvantages:**
- Less common in technical books
- Footnotes may not render well in GitHub Pages
- Requires Jekyll plugin support

**Effort:** 4 hours

---

## 9. Recommendation

## 11. Final Recommendation

**I recommend Alternative 1: Add Wikipedia links to glossary entries only.**

**Rationale:**
1. **Best effort-to-value ratio:** 1 hour of work provides 80% of the credibility benefit
2. **Preserves pedagogy:** Doesn't disrupt carefully crafted chapter flow
3. **Easier maintenance:** All links in one file (glossary.md)
4. **Better mobile experience:** Readers aren't clicking away mid-chapter
5. **Allows future expansion:** Can add chapter links later if desired
6. **Professional standard:** Many technical books link glossaries to external resources

**Implementation:**
- Modify each glossary entry to include Wikipedia link
- Format: `**Term** - [Wikipedia](URL)`
- Add note at top of glossary: "Terms link to Wikipedia for deeper context"
- Takes approximately 1 hour
- Can be done systematically without complex search/replace
