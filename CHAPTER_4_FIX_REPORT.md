# Chapter 4: Basic Sorting - Fix Report

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Status:** ✅ All formatting fixes applied (NOT PUSHED per user request)

---

## Executive Summary

Applied formatting standardization to `04-basic-sorting.md` following the standards documented in `Claude.md`. The current enhanced version (312 lines) was retained—no content was replaced with the original version from `/chapters`.

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Added chapter reference link to opening paragraph
2. ✅ Added function comments to 3 sorting functions
3. ✅ Formatted 8 Big O notation instances in backticks

**Total Changes:** 10 edits across 312-line chapter

## Detailed Changes

### Fix 1: Chapter Reference Link

**Location:** Line 14 (opening paragraph)

**Before:**
```markdown
As we saw with Big O notation, sorted data allows us to implement efficient algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
As we saw in [Chapter 2](02-measuring-performance.md), sorted data allows us to implement efficient algorithms.
```

**Why:** Provides specific backward reference to Chapter 2 where Big O vocabulary was introduced.

---

### Fix 2: Function Comments (3 instances)

#### 2a. Insertion Sort Function

**Location:** Line 119

**Before:**
```swift
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    func insertionSort() -> Array<Element> {
```

**After:**
```swift
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    // Sort array using insertion sort - efficient for nearly-sorted data
    func insertionSort() -> Array<Element> {
```

#### 2b. Bubble Sort Function

**Location:** Line 163

**Before:**
```swift
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    func bubbleSort() -> Array<Element> {
```

**After:**
```swift
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    // Sort array using bubble sort - repeatedly swaps adjacent elements
    func bubbleSort() -> Array<Element> {
```

#### 2c. Selection Sort Function

**Location:** Line 205

**Before:**
```swift
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    func selectionSort() -> Array<Element> {
```

**After:**
```swift
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    // Sort array using selection sort - minimizes swap operations
    func selectionSort() -> Array<Element> {
```

**Why:** Follows Claude.md standard requiring all functions to have descriptive single-sentence comments.

### Fix 3: Big O Notation Formatting (8 instances)

#### 3a. "Why O(n²)?" section

**Location:** Line 29

**Before:**
```markdown
all have **O(n²) time complexity** in their average and worst cases.
```

**After:**
```markdown
all have **`O(n²)` time complexity** in their average and worst cases.
```

#### 3b. "When to use" section

**Location:** Line 51

**Before:**
```markdown
Despite their O(n²) complexity, these algorithms have legitimate use cases:
```

**After:**
```markdown
Despite their `O(n²)` complexity, these algorithms have legitimate use cases:
```

#### 3c. Insertion sort best case

**Location:** Line 55

**Before:**
```markdown
- Data is already nearly sorted (best case: O(n))
```

**After:**
```markdown
- Data is already nearly sorted (best case: `O(n)`)
```

#### 3d. Comparison Table

**Location:** Lines 79-81

**Before:**
```markdown
| Insertion | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n²) | Yes | O(1) |
| Bubble | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n²) | Yes | O(1) |
| Selection | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n) | No | O(1) |
```

**After:**
```markdown
| Insertion | `O(n)` | `O(n²)` | `O(n²)` | `O(n²)` | Yes | `O(1)` |
| Bubble | `O(n)` | `O(n²)` | `O(n²)` | `O(n²)` | Yes | `O(1)` |
| Selection | `O(n²)` | `O(n²)` | `O(n²)` | `O(n)` | No | `O(1)` |
```

#### 3e. "Practical considerations" section

**Location:** Line 250

**Before:**
```markdown
You might wonder, "If these are O(n²), why learn them?" Here's why they matter:
```

**After:**
```markdown
You might wonder, "If these are `O(n²)`, why learn them?" Here's why they matter:
```

#### 3f-3g. Summary section

**Location:** Lines 300-301

**Before:**
```markdown
1. **All three are O(n²)** due to nested loops
2. **Insertion sort** is best for nearly-sorted data (O(n) best case)
```

**After:**
```markdown
1. **All three are `O(n²)`** due to nested loops
2. **Insertion sort** is best for nearly-sorted data (`O(n)` best case)
```

#### 3h. "Looking ahead" section

**Location:** Line 314

**Before:**
```markdown
achieve **O(n log n)** complexity—dramatically faster
```

**After:**
```markdown
achieve **`O(n log n)`** complexity—dramatically faster
```

**Why:** Follows Claude.md standard requiring all Big O notations to be wrapped in backticks.

## What Was NOT Changed

### Content Preserved

Based on the analysis in `CHAPTER_4_ANALYSIS.md`, the following valuable enhancements were **retained**:

1. ✅ **"Why O(n²)?" section** (lines 27-47) - Explains nested loops and quadratic growth
2. ✅ **"When to use" decision framework** (lines 49-74) - Practical guidance for each algorithm
3. ✅ **Comparison table** (lines 77-83) - Best/Average/Worst case analysis
4. ✅ **Visual analogies** (lines 92-109) - Playing cards, bubbling, finding minimum
5. ✅ **Real-world performance** (lines 85-90) - Small vs large dataset examples
6. ✅ **Practical considerations** (lines 243-291) - Production usage and performance context
7. ✅ **Summary section** (lines 292-316) - Key takeaways and looking ahead

**Total preserved enhancements:** ~184 lines of pedagogical value

### Original Content Not Used

The original version at `/Users/waynebishop/Projects/swift-algorithms/chapters/04_basic_sorting.md` (128 lines) was **not** used to replace the current version, as recommended in the analysis. The original lacked:

- ❌ Why these are O(n²)
- ❌ When to use each algorithm
- ❌ Performance comparison table
- ❌ Real-world guidance
- ❌ Visual analogies

---

## Formatting Standards Applied

All changes follow the standards documented in `Claude.md`:

### 1. Big O Notation Standard
✅ **All Big O complexity notations wrapped in inline code blocks using backticks**

Examples:
- `O(1)` - Constant time
- `O(n)` - Linear time
- `O(n²)` - Quadratic time
- `O(n log n)` - Linearithmic time

### 2. Function Comments Standard
✅ **Every function or method has a single-sentence descriptive comment**

Examples:
- `// Sort array using insertion sort - efficient for nearly-sorted data`
- `// Sort array using bubble sort - repeatedly swaps adjacent elements`
- `// Sort array using selection sort - minimizes swap operations`

### 3. Chapter References Standard
✅ **Backward references use specific chapter numbers with markdown links**

Format: `[Chapter X](0X-filename.md)`

Example: `[Chapter 2](02-measuring-performance.md)`

3. ⏳ Consider applying same formatting standards to remaining chapters (5-19)

**Status:** Ready for user review and approval to push.
