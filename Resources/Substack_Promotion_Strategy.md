# Substack Promotion Strategy: Swift Algorithms & Quiver Framework
## Content Marketing Plan for Wayne Bishop

**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Goal**: Attract attention from Google/Anthropic + Build Swift ML/Data Science authority
**Target**: Technical leaders, hiring managers, iOS developers, CS students

---

## Executive Summary: The Opportunity

**The Unique Position:**
- ‚úÖ **Quiver Framework** - First and only NumPy-equivalent for Swift (massive gap in ecosystem)
- ‚úÖ **5th Edition Book** - Nearly complete, 22 chapters, production Swift code
- ‚úÖ **Vector Database Work** - Semantic search implementation (riding AI wave)
- ‚úÖ **4-year dormancy** - Fresh start, big announcement opportunity
- ‚úÖ **Existing Medium audience** - Can reactivate + expand

**The Strategy:**
ONE unified publication combining book + Quiver with clear content streams. Position as "The Swift Data Science Authority" with compelling, technical content that demonstrates depth (for hiring managers) while providing immediate value (for developers).

---

## Part 1: Publication Strategy

### ONE Publication, Not Two

**Recommendation:** Single publication titled **"The Swift Data Scientist"** or **"Swift Algorithms Lab"**

**Rationale:**

| Consideration | One Publication | Two Publications |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Audience overlap** | High (iOS devs who need algorithms) | Partial split |
| **Brand strength** | Unified authority | Diluted brand |
| **Cross-promotion** | Natural, seamless | Requires explicit linking |
| **Maintenance** | One content calendar | Two separate calendars |
| **SEO/Discovery** | Concentrated authority | Split PageRank |
| **Hiring signal** | Clear expertise area | Scattered focus |

**The key insight:** Quiver exists to IMPLEMENT the algorithms from the book. They're not separate - they're a complete learning + implementation system. Google/Anthropic will see one cohesive expertise area, not two separate projects.

### Publication Title Options (Ranked)

1. **"The Swift Data Scientist"** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - Positions Wayne as THE authority (not "a" data scientist)
   - Clear niche: Swift + Data Science/ML
   - Appeals to both developers and hiring managers
   - Room for algorithms, ML, Quiver, career advice
   - Strong personal brand

2. **"Swift Algorithms Lab"** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - Implies experimentation and learning
   - "Lab" suggests cutting-edge work
   - Good for tutorials and deep dives
   - Less personal brand, more project-focused

3. **"Modern Swift Science"** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - Clean, professional
   - "Modern" signals relevance
   - "Science" covers data/algorithms/ML
   - Less memorable

4. **"Algorithmic Swift"** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - Direct, clear
   - Focus on algorithms
   - Doesn't emphasize ML/AI angle as much
   - Good but not as expansive

**RECOMMENDATION: "The Swift Data Scientist"**

**Tagline:** "Building ML and data science tools for the Swift ecosystem"
