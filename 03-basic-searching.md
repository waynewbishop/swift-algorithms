# Basic Searching

In [Chapter 2](02-measuring-performance.md) we learned the vocabulary of performanceâ€”Big O notation provides a common language for discussing algorithmic efficiency. Now it's time to apply that knowledge to your first concrete [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm). Whether we're building a contact app, a music library, or any system that manages information, search functionality is essential.

In this chapter, we'll explore two fundamental approaches to searching: linear search and [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm). We'll learn how each algorithm works, when to use it, and why the choice between `O(n)` and `O(log n)` makes such a dramatic difference as data grows.

## The search problem

At its core, searching involves answering a simple question: "Is this item in my collection?" However, the method you choose to answer this question can mean the difference between a lightning-fast response and a painfully slow operation.

Consider these real-world scenarios:
- Finding a contact in your phone's address book
- Locating a book in a library catalog
- Searching for a word in a dictionary
- Looking up a player's statistics in a sports database

Each scenario involves the same fundamental challenge, but the optimal approach depends on how the data is organized.

## The brute force approach

We've already encountered [linear search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search) in our Big O chapter, but let's examine it more thoroughly. Linear search represents the most straightforward approach to finding data: check every item until we find what we're looking for.

```swift
extension Array where Element: Equatable {
    // Search for an element using linear search, returning its index if found
    func linearSearch(for target: Element) -> Int? {

        for (index, element) in enumerated() {
            if element == target {
                return index
            }
        }

        return nil
    }
}

//test with unsorted data
let numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90, 5]
if let index = numbers.linearSearch(for: 22) {
    print("Found 22 at index \(index)")
} else {
    print("22 not found")
}
```

### When linear search shines

Linear search has several advantages that make it valuable in certain situations:

1. **Works with any data** - Sorted or unsorted, it doesn't matter
2. **Simple to implement** - Minimal chance of bugs
3. **Consistent performance** - No best or worst case surprises
4. **Memory efficient** - Uses no additional storage

### Linear search performance analysis

As we learned in the Big O chapter, linear search operates in `O(n)` time. But let's break down what this means in practice:

```swift
// Perform linear search while tracking the number of comparisons made
func analyzedLinearSearch<T: Equatable>(for target: T, in array: [T]) -> (index: Int?, comparisons: Int) {
    var comparisons = 0

    for (index, element) in array.enumerated() {
        comparisons += 1
        if element == target {
            return (index, comparisons)
        }
    }

    return (nil, comparisons)
}

let testData = [5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 9, 4, 0, 3, 7]

//best case: target is first element
let (_, bestCase) = analyzedLinearSearch(for: 5, in: testData)
print("Best case: \(bestCase) comparisons")

//average case: target in middle
let (_, avgCase) = analyzedLinearSearch(for: 1, in: testData)
print("Average case: \(avgCase) comparisons")

//worst case: target not found
let (_, worstCase) = analyzedLinearSearch(for: 15, in: testData)
print("Worst case: \(worstCase) comparisons")
```

This analysis reveals that while linear search is `O(n)` in the worst case, real-world performance varies significantly based on where the target is located.

## Divide and conquer

When the data is sorted, we can employ a much more efficient strategy. Binary search uses the [divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) approach, eliminating half of the remaining possibilities with each comparison.

### The phone book analogy

Imagine we're looking for "Smith" in a physical phone book. You wouldn't start from page 1 and flip through every page. Instead, you'd:

1. Open to the middle of the book
2. See if "Smith" comes before or after the names on that page
3. Eliminate half the book and repeat the process
4. Continue until we find "Smith" or determine it's not there

This intuitive process is exactly how binary search works.

### Binary search implementation

```swift
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    // Search for an element using binary search on a sorted array
    func binarySearch(for target: Element) -> Int? {
        var leftIndex = 0
        var rightIndex = count - 1

        while leftIndex <= rightIndex {
            let middleIndex = (leftIndex + rightIndex) / 2
            let middleValue = self[middleIndex]

            if middleValue == target {
                return middleIndex
            } else if middleValue < target {
                //target is in right half
                leftIndex = middleIndex + 1
            } else {
                //target is in left half
                rightIndex = middleIndex - 1
            }
        }

        return nil
    }
}

//test with sorted data
let sortedNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25]
if let index = sortedNumbers.binarySearch(for: 17) {
    print("Found 17 at index \(index)")
} else {
    print("17 not found")
}
```

### Understanding binary search performance

Binary search achieves `O(log n)` [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity). This logarithmic performance means that doubling the data size only adds one more step to the search process.

```swift
// Perform binary search while tracking comparisons and printing each step
func analyzedBinarySearch<T: Comparable>(for target: T, in array: [T]) -> (index: Int?, comparisons: Int) {
    var comparisons = 0
    var leftIndex = 0
    var rightIndex = array.count - 1

    while leftIndex <= rightIndex {
        comparisons += 1
        let middleIndex = (leftIndex + rightIndex) / 2
        let middleValue = array[middleIndex]

        print("Step \(comparisons): Checking index \(middleIndex) (value: \(middleValue))")

        if middleValue == target {
            return (middleIndex, comparisons)
        } else if middleValue < target {
            leftIndex = middleIndex + 1
        } else {
            rightIndex = middleIndex - 1
        }
    }

    return (nil, comparisons)
}

let largeSortedArray = Array(1...1000)
let (foundIndex, steps) = analyzedBinarySearch(for: 750, in: largeSortedArray)
print("Found 750 at index \(foundIndex ?? -1) in \(steps) steps")
```

### The power of logarithmic time

The efficiency of binary search becomes remarkable with large datasets.

**Note:** These numbers represent the maximum comparisons needed in the worst-case scenario:

| Array Size | Linear Search (worst) | Binary Search (worst) |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 100 | 100 comparisons | 7 comparisons |
| 1,000 | 1,000 comparisons | 10 comparisons |
| 10,000 | 10,000 comparisons | 14 comparisons |
| 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 comparisons | 20 comparisons |

This table demonstrates why binary search is preferred for large, sorted datasets. The logarithmic growth means that even massive collections can be searched in a reasonable number of steps.

## Sorted data

Binary search's efficiency comes with an important prerequisite: the data must be sorted. This requirement influences how you design your data management strategy.

```swift
//demonstrating the sorted data requirement
let unsortedData = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90, 5]
let sortedData = unsortedData.sorted()

//binary search on unsorted data may give incorrect results
print("Searching unsorted data for 22:")
if let index = unsortedData.binarySearch(for: 22) {
    print("Binary search claims 22 is at index \(index)")
    print("But actually 22 is at index \(unsortedData.firstIndex(of: 22)!)")
} else {
    print("Binary search couldn't find 22 in unsorted data")
}

//binary search on sorted data works correctly
print("\nSearching sorted data for 22:")
if let index = sortedData.binarySearch(for: 22) {
    print("Found 22 at index \(index) in sorted array")
}
```

## Choosing the right search strategy

The decision between linear and binary search depends on several factors:

### Use linear search when:
- **Data is unsorted** and sorting is expensive
- **Small datasets** where the overhead of sorting isn't worth it
- **Frequently changing data** where maintaining sorted order is costly
- **Simple implementation** is more important than optimal performance

### Use binary search when:
- **Data is already sorted** or we can afford to sort it
- **Large datasets** where the logarithmic advantage is significant
- **Read-heavy operations** where searches are more frequent than modifications
- **Performance is critical** and we can maintain sorted order

## Practical considerations

Consider a contact application where users frequently search for names but rarely add new contacts. Sorting the contacts once and using binary search for all subsequent lookups would be more efficient than using linear search repeatedly.

```swift
// Contact struct for demonstrating binary search in a contact manager application
struct Contact {
    let name: String
    let phone: String
}

// Conform Contact to Comparable protocol to enable binary search by name
extension Contact: Comparable {
    static func < (lhs: Contact, rhs: Contact) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name < rhs.name
    }

    static func == (lhs: Contact, rhs: Contact) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name == rhs.name
    }
}

class ContactManager {
    private var contacts: [Contact] = []

    // Add a new contact and maintain sorted order for efficient searching
    func addContact(_ contact: Contact) {
        contacts.append(contact)
        //keep contacts sorted for efficient searching
        contacts.sort { $0.name < $1.name }
    }

    // Find a contact by name using binary search
    func findContact(named name: String) -> Contact? {
        let searchContact = Contact(name: name, phone: "")

        if let index = contacts.binarySearch(for: searchContact) {
            return contacts[index]
        }

        return nil
    }
}
```

### Memory vs. time trade-offs

Sometimes we might maintain both sorted and unsorted versions of your data, trading memory for faster access patterns:

```swift
class OptimizedDataStore<T: Comparable> {
    private var insertionOrder: [T] = []  //for maintaining order of addition
    private var sortedData: [T] = []      //for fast searching

    // Add an item to both insertion-order and sorted arrays
    func add(_ item: T) {
        insertionOrder.append(item)

        //insert into sorted position
        let insertIndex = sortedData.binarySearchInsertionPoint(for: item)
        sortedData.insert(item, at: insertIndex)
    }

    // Search for an item using binary search on the sorted array
    func search(for item: T) -> Bool {
        return sortedData.binarySearch(for: item) != nil
    }

    // Return items in their original insertion order
    func itemsInOrder() -> [T] {
        return insertionOrder
    }
}

extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    // Find the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order
    func binarySearchInsertionPoint(for target: Element) -> Int {
        var leftIndex = 0
        var rightIndex = count

        while leftIndex < rightIndex {
            let middleIndex = (leftIndex + rightIndex) / 2

            if self[middleIndex] < target {
                leftIndex = middleIndex + 1
            } else {
                rightIndex = middleIndex
            }
        }

        return leftIndex
    }
}
```
