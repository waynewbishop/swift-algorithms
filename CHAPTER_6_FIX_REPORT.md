## Detailed Changes

### Fix 1: Chapter Reference (1 edit)

**Location:** Line 14 (opening paragraph)

**Before:**
```markdown
Now that we've explored algorithms and data structures through searching and sorting,
it's time to introduce one of the most powerful and elegant programming techniques:
recursion.
```

**After:**
```markdown
In [Chapter 5](05-advanced-sorting.md), we saw how Quicksort uses recursion to partition
and sort arrays. Now it's time to explore recursion more deeply as a fundamental
programming technique.
```

**Why:** Connects to previous chapter where recursion was used but not explained in depth.

### Fix 2: Convert Bullets to Prose (5 sections, 5 edits)

#### 2a. Family Tree Analogy (Lines 20-22)

**Before (bullets):**
```markdown
Consider how you might explain your family tree to someone:
- **Iterative approach**: List every person, generation by generation
- **Recursive approach**: "My family tree consists of me, plus my parents' family trees"

This recursive definition is both more concise and mirrors how family trees naturally work.
```

**After (prose):**
```markdown
Consider how you might explain your family tree to someone. An iterative approach would
require listing every person, generation by generation. A recursive approach, however,
is more elegant: "My family tree consists of me, plus my parents' family trees." This
recursive definition is both more concise and mirrors how family trees naturally work.
```

#### 2b. Base Case/Recursive Case (Lines 24-26)

**Before (H3 headings with separate explanations):**
```markdown
Every recursive solution has two essential components:

### 1. Base case
The condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, your function would call
itself indefinitely.

### 2. Recursive case
The part where the function calls itself with a modified version of the original problem.
```

**After (prose):**
```markdown
Every recursive solution has two essential components. The base case provides the
condition that stops the recursion—without it, your function would call itself
indefinitely. The recursive case is where the function calls itself with a modified
version of the original problem, gradually moving toward the base case.
```

#### 2c. When to Use Recursion (Lines 285-287)

**Before (bullets with H3 subheadings):**
```markdown
Recursion is particularly well-suited for:

### 1. Problems with recursive structure
- Tree traversals
- Graph searches
- Divide and conquer algorithms

### 2. Mathematical sequences
- Fibonacci numbers
- Factorials
- Combinatorics

### 3. Processing nested data
- JSON parsing
- File system traversal
- Nested arrays or dictionaries
```

**After (prose):**
```markdown
Recursion is particularly well-suited for problems with naturally recursive structure.
Tree traversals and graph searches become elegant when expressed recursively, as do
divide and conquer algorithms like the quicksort we explored in Chapter 5. Mathematical
sequences such as Fibonacci numbers, factorials, and combinatorics problems often have
simple recursive definitions that mirror their mathematical formulas. Finally, recursion
excels at processing nested data, whether parsing JSON, traversing file systems, or
navigating nested arrays and dictionaries. The key is recognizing when a problem can
be naturally decomposed into smaller instances of itself.
```

#### 2d. Looking Ahead (Lines 311-313)

**Before (bullets):**
```markdown
Understanding recursion is essential for the data structures we'll explore next:

- **Chapter 9 (Linked Lists)**: Recursive insertion and deletion
- **Chapter 11 (Binary Search Trees)**: Recursive tree operations
- **Chapter 12 (Graphs)**: Recursive graph traversal algorithms
- **Chapter 16 (Dynamic Programming)**: Recursive problem decomposition

The recursive thinking patterns you learn here will make these advanced topics much
more approachable.
```

**After (prose):**
```markdown
Understanding recursion is essential for the data structures we'll explore next. In
Chapter 9, you'll see how linked lists use recursive insertion and deletion. Chapter 11
introduces binary search trees, where recursive tree operations become fundamental.
Chapter 12 explores graphs with recursive traversal algorithms. Finally, Chapter 16
covers dynamic programming, which relies on recursive problem decomposition combined
with memoization techniques. The recursive thinking patterns you learn here will make
these advanced topics much more approachable.
```

#### 2e. Building Recursive Intuition (Lines 315-317)

**Before (numbered list):**
```markdown
When approaching a problem recursively, ask yourself:

1. **What's the simplest version of this problem?** (base case)
2. **How can I break the problem into smaller, similar problems?** (recursive case)
3. **How do I combine the results from subproblems?** (return value)
4. **Is this approach efficient enough?** (complexity analysis)

This framework will guide you toward elegant recursive solutions.
```

**After (prose):**
```markdown
When approaching a problem recursively, start by identifying the simplest version of
the problem—this becomes your base case. Then consider how to break the problem into
smaller, similar subproblems that move toward that base case. Next, determine how to
combine the results from these subproblems into your final answer. Finally, analyze
whether this recursive approach is efficient enough, or if you need optimizations like
memoization to avoid redundant calculations. This framework will guide you toward
elegant recursive solutions.
```

// Generate first n Fibonacci numbers using iteration

```

**Line 268:** `factorial(_ n: Int)` (tail recursion example)
```swift
// Calculate factorial - not tail recursive (multiplication after recursive call)
func factorial(_ n: Int) -> Int {
```

**Line 275:** `factorialTailRecursive(_ n: Int, accumulator: Int = 1)`
```swift
// Calculate factorial using tail recursion with accumulator pattern
func factorialTailRecursive(_ n: Int, accumulator: Int = 1) -> Int {
```

**Total:** 10 function comments added

### Fix 4: Add Explicit Big O Notation (2 edits)

**Line 161:**

**Before:**
```markdown
The simple recursive Fibonacci has a serious performance problem. Each call spawns two
more calls, creating an exponential number of function calls:
```

**After:**
```markdown
The simple recursive Fibonacci has a serious performance problem. Each call spawns two
more calls, creating an exponential number of function calls with `O(2^n)` time complexity:
```

**Line 182:**

**Before:**
```markdown
This demonstrates why understanding algorithm complexity (from Chapter 2) is crucial
when designing recursive solutions.
```

**After:**
```markdown
This demonstrates why understanding algorithm complexity (from Chapter 2) is crucial
when designing recursive solutions. The naive recursive approach runs in `O(2^n)` time,
while the memoized version improves to `O(n)`.
```

**Total:** 2 Big O additions

## Content Retained

### No Sections Removed

Based on content analysis, ALL sections were kept:

1. ✅ The recursive mindset (family tree analogy)
2. ✅ Understanding recursive structure (base case/recursive case)
3. ✅ Classes vs structs (why recursive data needs classes)
4. ✅ Fibonacci sequence (iterative, simple, counting, memoized versions)
5. ✅ Understanding recursive complexity (exponential problem)
6. ✅ Optimizing with memoization (preview of Chapter 16)
7. ✅ Recursive array processing (sum, max examples)
8. ✅ Tail recursion (advanced optimization)
9. ✅ When to use recursion (decision framework)
10. ✅ Recursion pitfalls (common mistakes)
11. ✅ Looking ahead (forward references to Chapters 9, 11, 12, 16)
12. ✅ Building recursive intuition (problem-solving framework)

**Why:** Every section serves a pedagogical purpose. Progressive complexity is intentional.

### Content Not Added

From original `/chapters/06_recursion.md`:

**Recursive enum (indirect enum):**
- Too advanced for intermediate audience
- Chapter already comprehensive at 318 lines
- Could be added to advanced appendix if needed

**Tree traversal (depth-first search):**
- Belongs in Chapter 11 (Binary Search Trees)
- Would require tree context not yet introduced
- Current array examples (sum, max) are more appropriate
