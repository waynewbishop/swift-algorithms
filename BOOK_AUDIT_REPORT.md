**Highest Impact:**
1. **Chapter 13: Graphs** - Core algorithm, high visibility
2. **Chapter 15: Hash Tables** - Foundation for understanding Dictionary
3. **Chapter 17: Shortest Paths** - Maps app connection natural

**Enhancement approach:**
- Same fitness theme for consistency
- iOS app openings (Maps for graphs/shortest paths, Dictionary for hash tables)
- Apps author uses where relevant
- Maintain technical accuracy (no code changes)

**Estimated impact:** Would bring overall book grade to A (93-95/100)

---

## Overall Assessment

### Before Enhancements
- **Grade:** B+ (85/100)
- **Voice consistency:** 27% of chapters
