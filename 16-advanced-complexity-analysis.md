# Practical Performance Analysis

Throughout this book, we've encountered various algorithmic complexities as we explored different data structures and algorithms. Now that you've seen Big O Notation in action across searching, sorting, recursion, and data structures, it's time to develop a deeper understanding of how algorithms perform in real-world scenarios.

This chapter builds upon the foundation we established in Chapter 2 (Big O Notation) and shows you how to analyze and optimize the code you write every day.

## Beyond simple Big O

While Big O Notation provides a powerful tool for comparing algorithms, real-world performance is often more nuanced than a simple O(n) or O(log n) classification suggests.

### Best case, average case, and worst case

Most algorithms don't perform the same way in every situation. Let's revisit the linear search from Chapter 3 and examine how it performs with different inputs:

```swift
func linearSearch<T: Equatable>(for target: T, in array: [T]) -> Int? {
    for (index, element) in array.enumerated() {
        if element == target {
            return index
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

**Consider searching for different values:**

```swift
let numbers = [5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 9, 4, 0, 3, 7]

// Best case: target is first element
linearSearch(for: 5, in: numbers)  // 1 comparison

// Average case: target is in the middle
linearSearch(for: 1, in: numbers)  // 5 comparisons

// Worst case: target is last or not present
linearSearch(for: 7, in: numbers)  // 10 comparisons
linearSearch(for: 15, in: numbers) // 10 comparisons (not found)
```

**Analysis of linear search:**

- **Best case**: O(1) - target is the first element, only one comparison needed
- **Average case**: O(n/2) - target is somewhere in the middle, but this still simplifies to O(n)
- **Worst case**: O(n) - target is the last element or not present, check every element

**Why this matters:**

If you're searching a sorted contact list where people often search for names near the beginning (like common names), the average case might be much better than the worst case in practice.

### When average case matters more

For frequently-used algorithms, average-case performance often matters more than worst-case performance. Hash tables (Chapter 13) provide an excellent example:

**Hash table performance:**

```swift
let hashTable = HashTable<String, String>()

// Most lookups: O(1) - hash directly to the value
hashTable.set("Alice", value: "alice@example.com")
hashTable.set("Bob", value: "bob@example.com")

// Average case: O(1) - instant lookup
let email = hashTable.get("Alice")  // Found immediately

// Worst case: O(n) - all values collided into same bucket
// (Very rare with good hash function)
```

**Real-world impact:**

- **Average case**: O(1) - the hash function distributes values evenly, lookups are instant
- **Worst case**: O(n) - all values hash to the same bucket (extremely unlikely)

In practice, a well-designed hash table provides near-constant time performance 99.9% of the time, making the average case far more relevant than the theoretical worst case.

## Understanding real-world performance patterns

Some algorithms have occasional expensive operations but maintain good performance over time. Let's explore how this works with a familiar structure: arrays.

### How Swift arrays grow automatically

When you append to an array that's run out of space, Swift automatically creates a larger array and copies everything over. Let's see what happens:

```swift
var numbers: [Int] = []

// Swift doubles the capacity each time it runs out of space
numbers.append(1)    // Array grows to capacity 1
numbers.append(2)    // Array grows to capacity 2
numbers.append(3)    // Array grows to capacity 4
numbers.append(4)    // No resize needed
numbers.append(5)    // Array grows to capacity 8
// ... and so on
```

**Individual operation costs:**

- Most appends: O(1) - just add to the end
- Resize appends: O(n) - copy all existing elements to new array

**Average over many operations:**

Even though some appends are expensive, the average cost per append is still O(1). Here's why:

```
Inserting 16 elements:
- 4 resizes occur (at positions 1, 2, 4, 8)
- Total copies: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15
- Average: 15 / 16 ≈ 1 copy per insertion

Inserting 1000 elements:
- About 10 resizes occur
- Average: still about 1 copy per insertion
```

The costly operations become rarer as the array grows, so the average remains constant.

### Practical implications

**When to pre-allocate capacity:**

```swift
// If you know you need 1000 elements
var numbers = [Int]()
numbers.reserveCapacity(1000)  // Pre-allocate space

// Now all 1000 appends are truly O(1)
for i in 0..<1000 {
    numbers.append(i)  // No resizing needed
}
```

## Space complexity

Throughout this book, we've primarily focused on time complexity (how long algorithms take), but space complexity (how much memory they use) is equally important, especially on mobile devices with limited memory.

### Analyzing space usage

**Space complexity measures:**
- **Auxiliary space**: Extra memory your algorithm uses beyond the input
- **Total space**: Input + auxiliary space

**Example: Insertion sort vs merge sort**

```swift
// Insertion sort: O(1) auxiliary space
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    mutating func insertionSort() {
        for i in 1..<count {
            let key = self[i]
            var j = i - 1

            while j >= 0 && self[j] > key {
                self[j + 1] = self[j]
                j -= 1
            }
            self[j + 1] = key
        }
    }
}

// Merge sort: O(n) auxiliary space
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    func mergeSort() -> [Element] {
        guard count > 1 else { return self }

        let mid = count / 2
        let left = Array(self[0..<mid]).mergeSort()
        let right = Array(self[mid..<count]).mergeSort()

        return merge(left, right)
    }

    private func merge(_ left: [Element], _ right: [Element]) -> [Element] {
        // Creates new arrays - uses O(n) space
        var result: [Element] = []
        var leftIndex = 0
        var rightIndex = 0

        while leftIndex < left.count && rightIndex < right.count {
            if left[leftIndex] <= right[rightIndex] {
                result.append(left[leftIndex])
                leftIndex += 1
            } else {
                result.append(right[rightIndex])
                rightIndex += 1
            }
        }

        result.append(contentsOf: left[leftIndex...])
        result.append(contentsOf: right[rightIndex...])

        return result
    }
}
```

**Comparison:**

| Algorithm | Time | Space | In-place? |
|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Insertion Sort | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n) | No |

**When to choose each:**
- **Limited memory** → Insertion sort (especially for small arrays)
- **Need speed with large data** → Merge sort (if you have memory available)

### Space-time trade-offs

You can often trade space for time or vice versa. The fibonacci example from Chapter 15 demonstrates this perfectly:

```swift
// Version 1: Minimal space, slow
func fibonacciNaive(_ n: Int) -> Int {
    if n <= 1 { return n }
    return fibonacciNaive(n - 1) + fibonacciNaive(n - 2)
}
// Time: O(2^n) - exponentially slow
// Space: O(n) - recursion call stack

// Version 2: More space, much faster
func fibonacciMemoized(_ n: Int, cache: inout [Int: Int]) -> Int {
    if let cached = cache[n] { return cached }
    if n <= 1 { return n }

    let result = fibonacciMemoized(n - 1, cache: &cache) +
                 fibonacciMemoized(n - 2, cache: &cache)
    cache[n] = result
    return result
}
// Time: O(n) - much faster!
// Space: O(n) - cache + call stack

// Version 3: Minimal space, fast
func fibonacciIterative(_ n: Int) -> Int {
    if n <= 1 { return n }

    var prev = 0
    var current = 1

    for _ in 2...n {
        let next = prev + current
        prev = current
        current = next
    }

    return current
}
// Time: O(n) - fast
// Space: O(1) - just two variables!
```

**Progression:**
1. **Simple but unusably slow** for large numbers
2. **Fast but uses memory** to store results
3. **Fast and memory-efficient** - best of both worlds

## Practical framework for analyzing algorithms

When you encounter any algorithm (whether from this book or in your own code), use this framework:

### Step 1: What's the basic operation?

Identify what your algorithm does most frequently:

- **Searching**: Comparisons (`if element == target`)
- **Sorting**: Comparisons and swaps
- **Tree operations**: Visiting nodes
- **Graph algorithms**: Traversing edges

### Step 2: How many times does it execute?

Count the operations as a function of input size n:

```swift
// Single loop: O(n)
for element in array {
    print(element)
}

// Nested loops: O(n²)
for i in array {
    for j in array {
        compare(i, j)
    }
}

// Logarithmic: O(log n)
var n = 100
while n > 1 {
    n = n / 2  // Halves each time
}

// Linearithmic: O(n log n)
// Divide in half, process each half
mergeSort(array)
```

### Step 3: Consider different scenarios

**Ask these questions:**

- **Best case**: What's the most favorable input? (e.g., already sorted array for insertion sort)
- **Average case**: What happens with typical, random input?
- **Worst case**: What's the most challenging input? (e.g., reverse-sorted array for bubble sort)

### Step 4: Analyze space usage

**Don't forget memory:**

- Do you create new arrays? → O(n) space
- Do you use recursion? → O(depth) space for call stack
- Do you modify in-place? → O(1) space
- Do you cache results? → O(cached items) space

## Real-world performance considerations

Academic complexity analysis doesn't always match real-world performance. Here's what else matters:

### 1. Constant factors can dominate for small inputs

**Theory says:**
- Quicksort: O(n log n)
- Insertion sort: O(n²)

**Reality:**
```swift
// For small arrays (n < 10), insertion sort often wins!
let small = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]

// Insertion sort: Simple, cache-friendly, low overhead
small.insertionSort()  // Faster for small n

// Quicksort: More complex, more overhead
small.quickSort()  // Slower for small n
```

Many production sorting algorithms (including Swift's) use insertion sort for small subarrays within a larger quicksort.

### 2. Memory access patterns matter

Modern CPUs are optimized for sequential memory access:

```swift
// Fast: Sequential access (cache-friendly)
for i in 0..<array.count {
    process(array[i])
}

// Slower: Random access (cache-unfriendly)
for index in randomIndices {
    process(array[index])
}
```

Both are O(n), but the first can be 10x faster due to CPU cache hits.

### 3. Real-world data isn't random

- **Partially sorted data**: Insertion sort can be nearly O(n)
- **Small datasets**: Simple O(n²) algorithms often win
- **Cached results**: Previously computed values make subsequent operations faster

## When to optimize (and when not to)

### Don't optimize prematurely

```swift
// Is this worth optimizing?
func processUsernames(_ users: [String]) {
    for user in users {  // Runs once per app launch
        print(user)      // ~100 users max
    }
}
```

**Answer: No.** This runs once with small data. O(n²) would be fine here.

### Do optimize when it matters

```swift
// This needs optimization!
func updateUI() {
    for frame in 0..<totalFrames {  // Runs 60 times per second
        for pixel in allPixels {     // Millions of pixels
            processPixel(pixel)      // Critical performance path
        }
    }
}
```

**Answer: Yes.** This runs constantly with large data. Even small improvements matter.

### Use profiling, not guessing

**Instead of guessing:**
```swift
// "This seems slow, let me optimize everything"
```

**Profile with Instruments:**
1. Run Xcode's Time Profiler
2. Find what's actually slow
3. Optimize that specific bottleneck
4. Measure again

## Looking back at the algorithms you've learned

Throughout this book, we've seen complexity analysis in action:

**Searching (Chapter 3):**
- Linear search: O(n)
- Binary search: O(log n)

**Sorting (Chapters 4-5):**
- Bubble/Insertion/Selection: O(n²)
- Merge/Quick sort: O(n log n)

**Data Structures:**
- Arrays: O(1) access, O(n) search
- Linked Lists: O(n) access, O(1) insert/delete
- Hash Tables: O(1) average, O(n) worst
- Binary Search Trees: O(log n) average, O(n) worst
- Heaps: O(log n) insert/delete, O(1) peek

**Graph Algorithms (Chapter 11):**
- BFS/DFS: O(V + E)
- Dijkstra (array): O(V²)
- Dijkstra (heap): O((V + E) log V)

## Building performance intuition

The goal isn't to memorize complexity formulas, but to develop intuition about what makes code fast or slow. When facing a new problem, ask:

### 1. What's the inherent complexity?

Some problems require examining every element:

```swift
// Must check every element - can't do better than O(n)
func findMax(in array: [Int]) -> Int? {
    var max = array.first
    for element in array {
        if element > max {
            max = element
        }
    }
    return max
}
```

### 2. Am I doing redundant work?

Look for repeated calculations:

```swift
// Bad: Recalculating the same thing
func inefficient(_ n: Int) -> Int {
    var total = 0
    for i in 0..<n {
        total += expensiveCalculation()  // Same result every time!
    }
    return total
}

// Good: Calculate once
func efficient(_ n: Int) -> Int {
    let value = expensiveCalculation()  // Once
    return value * n
}
```

### 3. What are my constraints?

**Consider all trade-offs:**
- **Time**: How fast must it run?
- **Space**: How much memory can I use?
- **Simplicity**: Does it need to be maintainable?
- **Correctness**: Must it handle all edge cases?

### 4. Is optimization worth it?

**Quick checklist:**
- ✅ Runs frequently (in a loop, per frame, per request)
- ✅ Handles large data (thousands to millions of items)
- ✅ Users notice the slowness
- ✅ Profiling confirms it's a bottleneck

If you don't check these boxes, simpler code might be better than faster code.

## Summary

Performance analysis helps you make informed decisions about algorithm design and optimization:

**Key concepts:**

1. **Best/Average/Worst case** - Algorithms perform differently on different inputs
2. **Average case often matters more** - especially for frequently-run code
3. **Space-time trade-offs** - You can often trade memory for speed or vice versa
4. **Real-world factors** - Cache, constants, and data patterns affect actual performance
5. **Optimize strategically** - Profile first, optimize bottlenecks, measure results

**Practical framework:**
1. Identify basic operations
2. Count executions as f(n)
3. Consider all cases
4. Analyze space usage
5. Profile before optimizing

**The most important lesson:**

Understanding complexity helps you choose the right algorithm and recognize when optimization matters. But always remember: **correct, maintainable code is better than prematurely optimized code**. Optimize only when profiling shows a real need.

This intuition, built through understanding the algorithms in this book and their trade-offs, will serve you well in designing efficient solutions to new problems.
